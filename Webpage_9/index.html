    <h4>Mythical Creatures</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Dragon</dt>
        <dd>A dragon is a magical legendary creature that appears in the folklore of multiple cultures worldwide.
            Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in Western cultures since the High
            Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, and capable of breathing fire.</dd>
        <dt>Phoenix</dt>
        <dd>The phoenix is an immortal bird that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. While it is part of
            Greek mythology, it has analogs in many cultures, such as Egyptian and Persian mythology. Associated with
            the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by rising from the ashes of its predecessor.</dd>
        <dt>Vampire</dt>
        <dd>A vampire is a mythical creature that subsists by feeding on the vital essence of the living. In European
            folklore, vampires are undead humanoid creatures that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths
            in the neighbourhoods which they inhabited while they were alive.</dd>
        <dt>Warewolf</dt>
        <dd>In European folklore, a werewolf is a man who turns into a dangerous animal at night. According to legend,
            the transformation of a werewolf is triggered by a full moon. Stories of werewolves have existed for
            thousands of years, but belief in werewolves became widespread in Europe during the Middle Ages.</dd>
